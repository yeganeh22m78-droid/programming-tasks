A2_T1: Basic program structure
Make a Python program, which prompts the user name and two floating numbers. Multiply the inserted numbers to get product. Round the product in two decimal precision. Complete the program output as shown below.

Example program run:

Program starting.
What is your name: John
Enter a floating point number: 3.1
Enter second floating point number: 5.3
John you gave numbers 3.1 and 5.3
Multiplying first and second number will result in product 16.43
Program ending.

A2_T2: Escape sequence and print parameters
Make a Python program, which prompts user for a car brand and model. After user inputs, do print the car brand and model sentence with two print commands using “sep” and “end” parameters.

Example program run:

Program starting.
Insert car brand: Toyota
Insert car model: Corolla
Car brand is "Toyota" and the model is 'Corolla'.
Program ending.

A2_T3: String length and concatenation
Make Python program, which prompts user to insert two words. Print the length of each word and then compound them together. Put single quotes around the compound word.

Example program run:

Program starting.
Insert first word: fire
Insert second word: fighter
1st word is 4 characters long.
2nd word is 7 characters long.
Words together makes one closed compound 'firefighter'.
Program ending.

A2_T4: Average and rounding
Prompt the user to insert the minutes spent on each previous topic task. Calculate the sum and the average. Display those in the example program run format(Note! precision). Make sure to calculate the required average for two decimal digits and later integer as rounded integer (precision 0 + type conversion).

Example program run:

Program starting.
Estimate how many minutes you spent on programming...

A1_T1: 3
A1_T2: 7
A1_T3: 9
A1_T4: 8
A1_T5: 13
A1_T6: 14
A1_T7: 21

In total you spent 75 minutes on programming.
Average per task was 10.71 min and same rounded to the nearest integer 11 min.

Program ending.

A2_T5 String length and slicing (TEST TASK)
Make a Python program, which prompts for a compound word.

Get following aspects from the word
Length
First character
Reversed version e.g. “Suitcase” is reversed “esactiuS”
Display the aspects using print commands.
Prompt the user to take substring from the existing compound word.
Finally print the user specified substring.
Example program run:

Program starting.

Insert a closed compound word: Moonbanana
The word you inserted is 'Moonbanana' and in reverse it is 'ananabnooM'.
The inserted word length is 10
Last character is 'a'

Take substring from the inserted word by inserting...
1) Starting point: 0
2) Ending point: 4
... 3) Step size: 1
... 
... The word 'Moonbanana' sliced to the defined substring is 'Moon'.
... Program ending.
... 
... A2_T6 Hex Colors (TEST TASK)
... Write a Python program which asks user to insert hex color. In this case hex color is expected to be the 7 character representation starting with # and followed by 6 0-F characters to represent RGB colors. More about hex colors at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors
... 
... Slice the amount of red, green and blue from that inserted color and display each color as shown below.
... 
... Example program run:
... 
... Program starting.
... 
... Insert a hex color: #FFA500
... 
... Colors
... - Red FF
... - Green A5
... - Blue 00
... 
... Program ending.
... 
... A2_T7 Fahrenheit to Celcius
... Create a Python program to convert Fahrenheit to Celcius. Round the Celsius to 1 decimal precision.
... 
... Formula to calculate Celcius from Fahrenheit is (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
... 
... Example program run:
... 
... Program starting.
... Insert fahrenheits: 50
... 50.0°F is 10.0°C
... Program ending.
